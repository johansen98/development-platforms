## Introduction
Azure DevOps is a cloud-based platform used to manage the lifespan of software development projects. The main purpose of Azure DevOps is to provide tools and services that allow the development team to work together on planning, development, testing, etc.

## Brief History
Azure is owned by Microsoft and was originally called Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS). VSTS was created in 2015 and changed its name to Azure DevOps in 2018. The rebranding of VSTS was done as a statement to make it clear that they would focus more on DevOps tools and cloud services.

VSTS (Azure DevOps) has become a very popular DevOps platform since its release back in 2015, but after the name change, the platform's popularity skyrocketed. This may have something to do with users seeing that Microsoft was creating a serious and professional developing platform with a lot of awesome and convenient tools to use.

Today, Azure is used by a lot of big companies and continues to grow.

## Features
- Azure Boards (planning and management tool)
- Azure Repos (source code control tool)
- Azure Test Plans (test automation and reporting)
- Azure Artifacts (package handling)
- Azure Pipelines (helps automate build, testing, and distribution processes)

Azure DevOps also gives users a good way to integrate third-party tools so you can use the tools you are used to and love.

## Strengths
Azure has many strengths that make it a good DevOps platform to choose to work with over others. I can list a few that come to mind:

1. Cloud-based platform. It makes working with Azure a great experience because it can be accessed anywhere you have an internet connection. Azure DevOps is very scalable, meaning you can easily scale it up or down to the project's criteria.

2. Integrated solution. Azure DevOps comes with a lot of tools that cover all that you would need from planning, development, testing, distribution, etc. It really makes it easier to have all the tools you need in one place that can be accessed from anywhere.

3. Security. Azure provides several functions and services to ensure that your code and software are safe.

## Weaknesses
While I think Azure DevOps is a good platform that provides a lot, I can also come with some downsides. Here are a few worth thinking about before choosing:

1. Price. Azure is an expensive platform. If you don't need all the tools that Azure provides, or the project doesn't have a lot of funding, it may be wise to find something else.

2. Dependent on cloud service. As Azure DevOps is a cloud-based service, you need a good connection. If there is anything wrong with your internet connection, it may impact your team's effort.

## Summary
In summary, Azure DevOps is a cloud-based developing platform with all the tools you will need from start to finish a dev project. A web developer has a lot to benefit from using a platform like Azure. For example, Azure DevOps provides a robust and comprehensive source code control software that is very similar to GitHub but works seamlessly with the other tools that Azure DevOps provides. So, if you have a big project and many people on your team, I would take a look at Azure. And, as I have read, it's a little expensive. So, if the project is small, I would find something else.
